# GIS scripts
## Intro

Repository showing the work done in the _GIS & Spatial Web_ module during my Erasmus studies at the [USW](https://www.southwales.ac.uk/). This [pdf](https://github.com/martinord/gis-apis/blob/master/docs/report.pdf) illustrates the purpose of this coursework.


## Usage

Download and open `default.htm` in a web browser. Nowadays there is no hosted version of this website.

Notice that maps using a private tile server or Google/Bing APIs need a key. Grab your own key to use them.

Also, for the last part of the coursework, it has been used a GeoServer. It is needed to be configured and installed with your own data. Use those scripts as a reference.
